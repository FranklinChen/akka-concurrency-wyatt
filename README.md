Worked though the examples in the pre-print of Derek Wyatt's book, Akka Concurrency. It's a well written book, but, a number of bugs were found in the text while working through the book, and I sometimes had to pick an arbitrary implementation for things where code was unexpectedly not provided or wouldn't compile, so the code here probably won't match the code in the final book.
